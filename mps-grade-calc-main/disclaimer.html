    <h1>Disclaimer For Using Infinite Campus Grade Importer</h1>

    <h3>Reagan administration has refused to host and control this app on their own accord, so they will not be able to verify that any data collected is used properly. If you do not currently understand, the Infinite Campus Grade Importer or "Grade Getter" sends your Infinite Campus credentials (username and password) to a backend server that I control, which then simulates an organic login to Infinite Campus, which then calls endpoints pertaining to grades. However, I <i>could</i> access way more than just grades, like home addresses, family information, vaccination records, or other pieces of confidential information, as long as I have your username and password.</h3>

    <h3>But I'm lazy and I don't want my life ruined by being charged and convicted of computer hacking and datamining (especially of minors), so I am not going to do that. There is no way to prove to you that I'm not, but upon rationally thinking about it, it should be obvious why I wouldn't: it means nothing to me and I stand nothing to gain from it. The thing that I stand to gain by providing this grade calculator for free of charge is that it looks good on my resume, it is fun to write and to maintain, it boosts grades and exploits the faulty grading system, and it boosts my ego--that's it! In the end, however, you can't trust me: just know that the grade importer works and make a judgment call, you're almost/already an adult!</h3>

    <h3>Anyone trying to find exploits or vulnerabilities in the backend for malicious intent or anyone who is trying to spam the backend will be permanently banned from using this service, by their Infinite Campus username. </h3>

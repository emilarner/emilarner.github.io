        <h1>Invitation System:</h1>

        <h2>This grade calculator has adopted an invitation system to help protect against spam, but more importantly, to aid in the proliferation of this program. A user who is not invited may still use this calculator to its fullest potential, but is going to be subject to cool downs. Similarly, an invited user may also suffer from cool down periods, unless they've made a sufficient number of invites themselves. Here's a table of the cooldowns for what type of student you are, in between pulling grades from classes.</h2>

            <table style="text-align: center;">
                <tr>
                    <th>Cool Down Period</th>

        <h2>Upon signing in to obtain grades from Infinite Campus, you will have an invitation code appear as text on the main calculator screen. If you haven't been invited, you cannot invite others yet. Give this code to someone and they will use it while logging in, setting their status to invited and increasing your invite count.</h2>
